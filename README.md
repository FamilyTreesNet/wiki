Imagine merging functionality like these into one interface...  

- [Left-to-Right, but no GEDCOM yet](https://yakubovich.github.io/descendant_tree/#stark) - 
[RedIt](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genealogy/comments/3ky3su/i_used_d3js_to_draw_fancy_descendant_charts/) - [List Layout](https://yakubovich.github.io/descendant_tree/book.html#stark) - [Github](https://github.com/Yakubovich/descendant_tree)  

- [Force Graph and "Play"](http://bengarvey.com/lineage/) - [Github](https://github.com/bengarvey/lineage) 

- [Lifespan using GEDCOM - Needs to be pivoted Left-to-Right](https://learnforeverlearn.com/ancestors/?lifespan=true)
